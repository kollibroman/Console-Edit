# ConsoleEdit 
From late stage beginner for late stage beginners (I'm sure that code is pretty shitty, buuut this is better than nothing)

In console Text editor like vim, made with https://cheuksblog.ca/tutorial/c++/2015/02/04/ncurses-editor-tutorial-03.html but ported to c#.
I'm using ported cpp Ncurses library from @rnowley which you can find here: https://github.com/rnowley/csharp-ncurses
Can be same with parts of code from @McNeight,where he made this in a hard way, here is a link to his repo: https://github.com/McNeight/CheukEdit
Not sure to this moment if it works because of the Ncurses wrapper which was written in netstandard 2.0 times. After test I will update reame.md

Soooo as I said earlier, after testing it out it doesn't work. For this moment it is issue withc-sharp-ncurses, I will try to fix it
